SKILL DRILL 15.2.4 
# What questions would you want answered if you were opening a bike-sharing business? Write the questions down.
... How many trips are taken each day, month, year?
... What is the average cost each trip taken? 
... Why do people care for the service I offer, how do I compare to my competitors? 

# (SKILL DRILL 15.3.5) is the same as "Bike Repairs", just converted to show chronological order; with how many times each bike is used. 

# Deliverable 3:
1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  - The purpose of our analysis consisted of us gathering information for Kate, a data analyst. Our analysis requirements were to help Kate in finding which data would be best suitable for starting her own business from the data set given by Citi Bike riders within the month of August, in New York City; around the time her and her friend vacationed. I was able to explain, in detail, a general response of how Ms. Kate is able to begin her startup; in her residing city of Des Moines. Tableau was my best viable option for the explanation of this analysis, I would be able to provide detail in visualizations that would make a potential presentation standout; outstanding even. 

2. Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
