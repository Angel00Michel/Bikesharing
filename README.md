SKILL DRILL 15.2.4 
### What questions would you want answered if you were opening a bike-sharing business? Write the questions down.
... How many trips are taken each day, month, year?
... What is the average cost each trip taken? 
... Why do people care for the service I offer, how do I compare to my competitors? 

### (SKILL DRILL 15.3.5) is the same as "Bike Repairs", just converted to show chronological order; with how many times each bike is used. 

# Deliverable 3:
### 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  - The purpose of our analysis consisted of us gathering information for Kate, a data analyst. Our analysis requirements were to help Kate in finding which data would be best suitable for starting her own business from the data set given by Citi Bike riders within the month of August, in New York City; around the time her and her friend vacationed. I was able to explain, in detail, a general response of how Ms. Kate is able to begin her startup; in her residing city of Des Moines. Tableau was my best viable option for the explanation of this analysis, I would be able to provide detail in visualizations that would make a potential presentation standout; outstanding even. 

### 2. Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

This Pie Chart best demonstrates the amount of bikes each gender using, with its respective values.

### 3. Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

  -- According to my Storyboard visualization that I was able to piece together, the analysis seems preety simple; taking the data from our "Bikesharing.csv" file then importing it into a detailed respresentation of why creating a Bikesharing business may even be a great startup concept for 2023. The analysis displays intricate visualizations explaining as to how and for why a Bikesharing business is a great idea, in a busy city of course. Our data shows how many people actively use bikesharing services to get around on their daily commmute, or even if they wanted to go tour the city and experience something that is everlasting. My Tableua analysis accurately displays how each "Gender" could impact our product, the amount of people using bikesharing services, as well as quantative representations of how often people (from all genders) could hypothetically interact with our services. I was able to display multiple depictions of how I see a bikesharing business thriving in today's economy. 

  -- I was able to conclude that male riders average about 65% of the total population, that were operate bikesharing services within the month of August in New York City. On the other hand, female riders roughly make up about 25% of the population; the remaining population (10%) are classified as an "UNKNOWN" gender, as in not wanting to be indentified. The total population of riders accounted for 2,344,223 (roughly 2.34 million bikes were used). A precise depiction of how many bikes were checked out/used in the month of August, specifc to each gender. This depiction enlightens us to believe that all bikes that were checked out/used, regardless of gender, peaked during the hours of 5:00 AM - 8:00 AM each day during hours; peaked again during the of 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM each day for the whole month of August! This truly paints a grat picture that most of the bike that were used, regardless of the destination, were used during peak Rush Hour timeframes (people normally commute to work/school/daily activites during these hours).
